I want to create a Github Page to serve a simple go bot that uses the following strategy: it finds the lexicographically smallest legal move on the board and plays it. Each player MUST move (no passes allowed), and the player without a legal move loses. There is no ko rule. Please implement an index.html with css and javascript to display a n*n board and allow a user to play against the bot. n can be set by the user. The user should be able to click on a crossing to place a stone, and the bot should respond with its move. The game should end when there are no legal moves left for either player. The goal of the player is to let the bot win.
